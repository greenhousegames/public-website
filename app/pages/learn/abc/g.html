content: Take a look at the three <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  The left sprite
  does not have gravity applied to it.  The middle and right sprites have gravity applied to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Due to having no gravity, the left sprite does not move once placed in the game.  This results in the
  object having no <a href="v.html">velocity</a> or <a href="a.html">acceleration</a>.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Due to having gravity applied to the world, the middle and right sprite increase in acceleration,
  causing them to fall to the ground.  Once the objects hit the ground, the <a href="b.html">bounce</a>
  defines whether or not the object will rebound off the ground.  The middle sprite has no bounce and the
  right sprite has 100% bounce.
