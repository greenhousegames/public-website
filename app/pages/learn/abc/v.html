content: Take a look at the three <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  All
  sprites start out at the same <a href="x.html">x</a> position.  The bottom sprite
  has zero velocity, the top sprite has positive velocity and the middle sprite has
  half the velocity of the top sprite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Due to not having any velocity, the x position of the bottom sprite does not change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Due to having positive velocity, the x position of the top sprite increases over time
  until it hits the wall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Due to having half the velocity of the top sprite, the middle sprite travels half the distance
  of the top sprite in the same amount of time.  This causes the middle sprite to be half
  way across the game once the top sprite reaches the wall.
