content: Take a look at the <a href="s.html">sprite</a> in the game.  Notice how
 the sprite falls to the ground due to <a href="g.html">gravity</a>.  Tap the
 screen to have  the sprite jump into the air once it is on the ground.

 <br/>
 To make a sprite jump, the <a href="v.html">velocity</a> of the sprite must be
 set so it moves upward.  As discussed in the velocity lesson, this will cause
 the sprite to move at a constant speed.  The effect of gravity causes the
 sprite to want to <a href="a.html">accelerate</a> downward.  This combination
 of upward velocity and downward acceleration causes the sprite to slow down as
 it reaches the middle of the screen, then speed up as it approaches the ground.
