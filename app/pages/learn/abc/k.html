content: Take a look at the <a href="s.html">sprite</a> in the game.  The
 sprite is given a random <a href="v.html">velocity</a> and has
 <a href="d.html">dragging</a> enabled. If the sprite goes outside of the world
 bounds it will be killed.  A <a href="t.html">timer</a> will be used to revive
 the sprite 3 seconds after it is killed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Killing a sprite is a way to remove the sprite from the game.  This causes the
 sprite to be hidden and all interactions with the sprite are disabled.  The
 sprite can be revived, in which cause it is made visible and can interact with
 the rest of the world.
