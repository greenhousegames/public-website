content: Take a look at the three <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  The
 middle sprite is given a random <a href="v.html">velocity</a> and has
 <a href="b.html">bounce</a> enabled. The left and right sprite are
 <a href="i.html">immovable</a>.  The middle sprite will be killed if it
 <a href="c.html">collides</a> with either the left or right sprite. A
 <a href="t.html">timer</a> will be used to revive the middle sprite one second
 after it is killed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Killing a sprite is a way to remove the sprite from the game.  This causes the
 sprite to be hidden and all interactions with the sprite are disabled.  The
 sprite can be revived, in which cause it is made visible and can interact with
 the rest of the world.
