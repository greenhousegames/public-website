title: Learning | Z-index
letter: z
header: Z is for Z-index
subheader: Z-index is the layering of objects
prev: y.html
content: Take a look at the three <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  The left-most
  sprite was added to the game first, followed by the middle sprite, followed by the right-most
  sprite.  Each time a sprite is added, it appears on top of all other sprites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Due to being added first, the left-most sprite is covered by the other two sprites.
  This causes the left-most sprite to have the lowest z-index.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Due to being added last, the right-most sprite is on top of the other two sprites.
  This causes the right-most sprite to have the highest z-index.
