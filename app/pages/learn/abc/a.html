title: Learning | Acceleration
heading: A is for Acceleration
subheading: Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity over time
content: In this example, the greenhouse is set to accelerate towards the pointer with a max
  acceleration of 100.  Notice how the velocity increases over time as the
  icon accelerates towards the pointer.  Once the icon passes the pointer, the
  icon begins to accelerate in the opposite direction.  This causes the icon
  to slow down until it reaches a velocity of zero.  Once the icon reaches zero
  velocity, it begins to move back towards the pointer.
