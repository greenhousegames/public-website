title: Learning | Acceleration
letter: a
header: A is for Acceleration
subheader: Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity over time
next: b.html
content: Take a look at the two <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  Both
  sprites start out with the same <a href="v.html">velocity</a>.  The bottom sprite
  has zero acceleration and the top sprite has positive acceleration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Due to not having any acceleration, the velocity of the bottom sprite does not change.
  This is similar to cruise control in a car.  When cruise control is activated,
  the speed of the car stays constant.  This results in the car having zero acceleration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Due to having positive acceleration, the velocity of the top sprite increases over time.
  This is similar to a gas pedal in a car.  When the gas pedal is pressed, the
  speed of the car increases.  This results in the car having positive acceleration.
