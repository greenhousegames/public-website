    <h4>Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity over time</h4>
    <p>
      In this example, the greenhouse icon is set to accelerate towards the pointer with a max
      acceleration of 100.  Notice how the velocity increases over time as the
      icon accelerates towards the pointer.  Once the icon passes the pointer, the
      icon begins to accelerate in the opposite direction.  This causes the icon
      to slow down until it reaches a velocity of zero.  Once the icon reaches zero
      velocity, it begins to move back towards the pointer.
