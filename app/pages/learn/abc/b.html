content: Take a look at the three <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  All
  sprites start out with the same <a href="v.html">velocity</a>.  The bottom sprite
  has zero bounce, the middle sprite has 75% bounce, and the top sprite has 100% bounce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Due to having 100% bounce, the top sprite rebounds off the wall at the same speed.
  This causes the velocity of the top sprite to be the same before and after hitting
  the wall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Due to having zero bounce, the bottom sprite does not rebound off the wall.  This
  causes the velocity of the bottom sprite to be zero after it hits the wall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Due to having between zero and 100% bounce, the middle sprite rebounds off the wall,
  but at a slower speed.  This causes the velocity of the middle sprite to be 75%
  the speed after hitting the wall.
