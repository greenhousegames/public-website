a:
  order: 6
  letter: a
  header: A is for Acceleration
  subheader: Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity over time
  dependencies:
    - s
    - v
  content: Take a look at the two <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  Both
    sprites start out with the same <a href="v.html">velocity</a>.  The bottom sprite
    has zero acceleration and the top sprite has positive acceleration.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to not having any acceleration, the velocity of the bottom sprite does not change.
    This is similar to cruise control in a car.  When cruise control is activated,
    the speed of the car stays constant.  This results in the car having zero acceleration.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to having positive acceleration, the velocity of the top sprite increases over time.
    This is similar to a gas pedal in a car.  When the gas pedal is pressed, the
    speed of the car increases.  This results in the car having positive acceleration.
b:
  order: 7
  letter: b
  header: B is for Bounce
  subheader: Bounce is the elasticity of an object
  dependencies:
    - s
    - v
  content: Take a look at the three <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  All
    sprites start out with the same <a href="v.html">velocity</a>.  The bottom sprite
    has zero bounce, the middle sprite has 75% bounce, and the top sprite has 100% bounce.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to having 100% bounce, the top sprite rebounds off the wall at the same speed.
    This causes the velocity of the top sprite to be the same before and after hitting
    the wall.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to having zero bounce, the bottom sprite does not rebound off the wall.  This
    causes the velocity of the bottom sprite to be zero after it hits the wall.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to having between zero and 100% bounce, the middle sprite rebounds off the wall,
    but at a slower speed.  This causes the velocity of the middle sprite to be 75%
    the speed after hitting the wall.
c:
  order: 12
  letter: c
  header: C is for Collision
  subheader: Collision causes objects to hit each other
  dependencies:
    - s
  content: Take a look at the <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  Collision is enabled
    for the top two sprites and disabled for the bottom two sprites.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to having collision disabled, the bottom two sprites pass through each other when they
    intersect.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to having collision enabled, the top two sprites rebound off each other when they intersect.
d:
  order: 13

  header: D is for Drag
  subheader: Dragging is a way to interact with an object
  dependencies:
    - s
  content: Take a look at the two <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  Dragging is disabled
    for the left sprite and enabled for the right sprite.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to having dragging disabled, the left sprite does not move when you touch it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to having dragging enabled, the right sprite moves when you hold and drag it around the game.
e:

  letter: f
  header: F is for Frames
  subheader: Frames are used to design animations
  dependencies:
    - s
  content: Take a look at the <a href="s.html">sprite</a> in the game.  The sprite
   will animate for one loop once the A button is pressed.  Pressing the B button will
   run the animation in a loop.  Pressing the C button will stop the animation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An animation is created using still images called frames.  Each frame is
   displayed for a split second before showing the next frame.  The animation shown
   above was created using 10 frames.  The frames are ordered in such a way that
   it gives the effect the ninja is running.
g:

  content: Take a look at the three <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  The left sprite
    does not have gravity applied to it.  The middle and right sprites have gravity applied to them.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to having no gravity, the left sprite does not move once placed in the game.  This results in the
    object having no <a href="v.html">velocity</a> or <a href="a.html">acceleration</a>.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to having gravity applied to the world, the middle and right sprite increase in acceleration,
    causing them to fall to the ground.  Once the objects hit the ground, the <a href="b.html">bounce</a>
    defines whether or not the object will rebound off the ground.  The middle sprite has no bounce and the
    right sprite has 100% bounce.
h:

  content: Take a look at the <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  The center sprite is set to immovable.  When other sprites
    <a href="c.html">collide</a> with the center sprite, they will <a href="b.html">bounce</a> off.
j:

  header: J is for Jump
  subheader: Jumping is a way to control an object
  dependencies:
    - a

    - v
  content: Take a look at the <a href="s.html">sprite</a> in the game.  Notice how
   the sprite falls to the ground due to <a href="g.html">gravity</a>.  Tap the
   A button to have  the sprite jump into the air once it is on the ground.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To make a sprite jump, the <a href="v.html">velocity</a> of the sprite must be
   set so it moves upward.  As discussed in the velocity lesson, this will cause
   the sprite to move at a constant speed.  The effect of gravity causes the
   sprite to want to <a href="a.html">accelerate</a> downward.  This combination
   of upward velocity and downward acceleration causes the sprite to slow down as
   it reaches the middle of the screen, then speed up as it approaches the ground.
k:
  order: 16

  content: Take a look at the three <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  The
   middle sprite is given a random <a href="v.html">velocity</a> and has
   <a href="b.html">bounce</a> enabled. The left and right sprite are
   <a href="i.html">immovable</a>.  The middle sprite will be killed if it
   <a href="c.html">collides</a> with either the left or right sprite. A
   <a href="t.html">timer</a> will be used to revive the middle sprite one second
   after it is killed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Killing a sprite is a way to remove the sprite from the game.  This causes the
   sprite to be hidden and all interactions with the sprite are disabled.  The
   sprite can be revived, in which cause it is made visible and can interact with
   the rest of the world.
l:

   has been given 100 <a href="h.html">health</a> and 3 lives.  Tapping the A button
   will inflict 10 damage on the sprite.  Tapping the B button will give the sprite 1
   additional health.  The sprite will lose 1 life and be <a href="k.html">killed</a>
   when it reaches zero health. The sprite will be revived if it has remaining lives.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lives are a way to track how long the user can play the game.  The user can continue
   to play the game so long as they have lives remaining.  Once the user runs out of life

  content: Take a look at the three <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  All
    sprites start out at the same <a href="x.html">x</a> position.  The bottom sprite
    has zero velocity, the top sprite has positive velocity and the middle sprite has
    half the velocity of the top sprite.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to not having any velocity, the x position of the bottom sprite does not change.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to having positive velocity, the x position of the top sprite increases over time
    until it hits the wall.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to having half the velocity of the top sprite, the middle sprite travels half the distance
    of the top sprite in the same amount of time.  This causes the middle sprite to be half
    way across the game once the top sprite reaches the wall.
w:

   <br/>
   A new sprite is created in the game when the weapon fires a bullet.  The bullet
   is given a <a href="v.html">velocity</a> in the direction where the tap
   occurred.  In this example the bullet just flies off into space, but in a real

  content: Take a look at the three <a href="s.html">sprites</a> in the game.  The left-most
    sprite was added to the game first, followed by the middle sprite, followed by the right-most
    sprite.  Each time a sprite is added, it appears on top of all other sprites.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to being added first, the left-most sprite is covered by the other two sprites.
    This causes the left-most sprite to have the lowest z-index.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to being added last, the right-most sprite is on top of the other two sprites.
    This causes the right-most sprite to have the highest z-index.
